## Urza.ai deck maker (for cockatrice)

### Have a great time with friends by allowing an ai to completely generate an MTG. ITS PRETYTY EPICEK

## Program

Simple web scraper that spams urza.ai until all cards name in "names.txt" are combined into a compatible xml file.

1. Add all names to a ./names.txt file (didnt care to handle empty space)
2. run node urza_scraper.js [OUTPUT-FILE-NAME] [OUTPUT-SET-NAME]
3. Add the .xml file to the custom databases folder of cockatrice
4. PROFIT!?!!!???????

#### We do a little [some] webscraping

## Todo

- Append to xml files

- Allow for specific options

- HOW DO YOU MAKE WEBSCRAPERS NOT BECOME OBSOLETE
